/*  Main thread converts to a fiber, then creates a number of fibers depending on NUM_THREADS. 
    It will spawn later NUM_THREADS threads, each of one converting to fiber.
    All threads, except the main one, will switch to a fiber beginning a chain of 3 consecutive switches. 
    Each thread will write on an array to notify nothing more to do, in such a way the main can exit when all the job
    is done!
    
    Notice that NUM_THREADS can be at most 409, because in this way the number of fibers created by this process will be
    409 + 4x409 + 1 = 410 + 1636 = 2046 < 2048 (maximum number of fibers). 
    Adding just one thread will cause some fibers impossible to create, causing kernel errors ;-) */
